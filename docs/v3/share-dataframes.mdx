## Sharing Dataframes

Dataframes can be shared through the PandasAI Data Platform at [app.pandabi.ai](https://app.pandabi.ai). Once you've created your dataframes using the [semantic layer](/v3/semantic-layer), you can upload and manage them through the platform interface.

The platform provides a collaborative environment where:

- Team members can access shared dataframes
- Business users can chat with your data using natural language
- Permissions can be managed centrally
